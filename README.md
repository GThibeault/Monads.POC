# Monads.POC
Simple POC to show the use of monads to improve handling of common use cases in .NET Core web programming, such as error handling, logging, tracking, metric gathering and so on.

The different monads are presented as minimal POCs to showcase certain functionality, in real use some could be merged (such as the ProcessMonad and LoggerMonad), or even baked into base functionality common to all monads.
